# SQL Practice

SQL practice problems for various datasets.

PostgreSQL (v. 11) was used for the baseball and tennis datasets.  SQLite (v. 3) was used for the soccer dataset (since it's a SQLite database to begin with).

I follow Kickstarter's SQL style guide ([blog post](https://kickstarter.engineering/our-sql-style-guide-8a1c24a6fe0f), [GitHub gist](https://gist.github.com/fredbenenson/7bb92718e19138c20591)).
